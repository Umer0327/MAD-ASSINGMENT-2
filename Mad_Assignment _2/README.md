# Travel Guide App

Simple Flutter app for the assignment. Implements three screens: Home, List, and About. Uses network images from Unsplash so no local assets are required.

How to run:

1. Ensure Flutter SDK is installed and on PATH.
2. From this project folder, run:

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Notes:
- The app uses `Image.network` for images. You'll need internet access when running the app.
- The `pubspec.yaml` in this folder is minimal; you can adjust SDK constraints if your Flutter version differs.
